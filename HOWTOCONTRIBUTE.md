Code practices

Please help us follow the best practice to make it easy for the reviewer as well as the contributor. We want to focus on the code quality more than on managing pull request ethics.

Single commit per pull request
For writing commit messages please read the COMMITSTYLE carefully. Kindly adhere to the guidelines.
Add your code to the folders corresponding to the specific issue being solved.
While adding solutions to Codechef problems add your codechef profile link and your submission link as comments. 
Before optimizing any problem go through the problem statement carefully and in the final submission also add relevant test cases as comments.
If the PR is related to any changes in the UI, please attach relevant screenshots in the pull request description.

Before you join development, please set up the project on your local machine, run it and go through the application completely. 
If you would like to work on an issue, drop in a comment at the issue. If it is already assigned to someone, but there is no sign of any work being done, please free to drop in a comment so that the issue can be assigned to you if the previous assignee has dropped it entirely.
